Scripts to Run
In the project directory, you can use the following commands:

npm start
Launches the app in development mode.
Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view it.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the source code.
You might also see linting errors in the console.

npm test
Starts the test runner in interactive watch mode.
For more details, see running tests.

npm run build
Compiles the app for production and outputs the files to the build folder.
It minifies the code and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The filenames include hashes for caching purposes.
Your app is now ready to be deployed!

For more information, see deployment.

npm run eject
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you cannot revert back!

If you need more control over the configuration, you can eject at any time. This will copy all the configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, allowing full control over them. All the usual commands will still work, but they will use your customized scripts.

However, most users do not need to use eject. The default setup is suitable for small to medium deployments. Only use this feature if you need to customize the configuration.

Additional Information
You can find more details in the Create React App documentation.
